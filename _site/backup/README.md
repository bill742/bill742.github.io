Hello World! My name is Bill Dean and I'm a web developer based in Toronto, Canada. This is the repo for my personal GitHub.io page.

About this site

This is approximately the 8th (or 9th, or is it 10th?) version of my personal website. This however is the first time that I've gotten around to including a blog. The site has been built using Jekyll. 

**TODO:**
+ Add picture.
