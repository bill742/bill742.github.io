      <p>
        I&apos;m a front-end-focused web developer with over 10 years of
        experience building dynamic, scalable, and accessible user interfaces. I
        specialize in React, TypeScript, and modern UI frameworks, with a strong
        background in state management, API integration, and performance
        optimization. Whether it’s creating reusable components, improving
        accessibility, or collaborating with cross-functional teams, I’m
        passionate about delivering high-quality, user-centered web experiences.
