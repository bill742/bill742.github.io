Hello World! My name is Bill Dean and I'm a web developer based in Toronto, Canada. This is the repo for my GitHub.io page. As always, it is a work in progress.

**TODO:**
+ ~~Add portfolio section.~~
+ ~~Add favicon.~~
+ ~~Update intro copy.~~
+ Add picture.
+ Add contact form.
+ Create content for blog.
+ Add blog to nav.
+ Eventually rebuild to include CMS and blogging functionality.
